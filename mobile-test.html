					<h1>The Non-Proposal</h1>
					<div class="bimage">
						<img src="./images/sunset.jpg"/>
						<h2>August 15th, 2015</h2>
					</div>
					<div class="bleft">
						<p>Before the proposal was the "non-proposal". Jason and Ann had a summer trip planned to the Pacific Northwest. The plan was to fly into Washington State and drive down the Pacific Coast Highway to San Francisco stopping at various destinations along the way with Redwood National and State Parks as the highlight. Sadly, there was a slight wrinkle in the plan as Jason had to attend a sudden funeral before the trip. While attending the funeral, Jason realized life was short and precious. While he wasn't ready to propose, he wanted to be prepared for when the time came. So he sold some stock so he would have the funds on hand needed to buy an engagement ring. One week later, Jason and Ann were roaming around the dense California redwood forests. As the day wound down, they decided to explore Fern Canyon before watching the sunset at Gold Bluffs Beach. They emerged from the canyon just before sunset and the beach was completely empty with not a soul in sight.</p>
					</div>

					<div class="bright">
						<p>As Ann stood on the beach staring into the sunset, Jason recognized the romantic intimacy of the moment. He wanted to say something meaningful and profound when suddenly he had an epiphany! He walked up behind Ann, tapped her on the shoulder and told her that he had something important to share. After attending the funeral the previous week, Jason realized that life is short and there wasn't any sense in waiting. He knew that he loved Ann and wanted to spend their lives together. As tears welled up in Ann's eyes, Jason proceeded to pull his phone out of his pocket and <a class="photo-gallery" href="./images/bank-screenshot.jpg">proudly showed</a> Ann how he had saved up enough money to buy her a ring someday! An expectant Ann asked "...and?" to which Jason innocently replied "oh - that was it" ignorant to the fact that he had missed the perfect opportunity to propose. Ann would disappointedly have to wait while Jason obliviously patted himself on the back for "successfully" saying something profound and taking advantage of the moment.</p>

					<h1>The Proposal</h1>
					<div class="bimage">
						<img src="./images/boston.jpg"/>
						<h2>February 13th, 2016</h2>
					</div>

					<div class="bleft">
						<p>With the cat out of the bag after the <a href="#nonproposal">"non-proposal"</a>, the pressure was on for Jason to find a surprising moment to <em>actually</em> propose. With Ann being a teacher, the only reasonable time to get married and enjoy a honeymoon was summer. After spending months looking for the right ring together, Jason knew he had to speed up the process lest they have to wait until summer 2017 to be married. With the actual ring search at a roadblock, Jason set out to find a sentimentally appropriate placeholder ring. Given his <a href="#nonproposal">debacle</a> at the redwoods, he thought it would be poetic that the placeholder ring would be made from California redwood. He found <a class="outbound" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this.href); return false;" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/Archipelago23">an artisan</a> who crafted rings from California redwood and could use a custom gem as the center stone. With the redwood representing the end of their Pacific Northwest trip, Jason acquired a small Helenite stone - a gem made from the ash of Mount St. Helen to represent the start of their memorable trip. And thus, Jason had a <a class="photo-gallery" href="./images/ring.jpg">placeholder ring</a> to propose with. Now he just needed a way to surprise Ann.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="bright">
						<p>Ann was attending the 2016 ACDA Divisional Conference in Boston over Valentine's Day weekend. With Jason's company holding their annual meetings the following week, by the time Ann would be getting back from Boston, he'd already be on the way to Orlando. And so Jason hatched a plan to surprise Ann in Boston and enlisted the help Ann's friends and her mother - fellow choral directors who would also be in Boston for the same conference. Jason arrived in Boston the afternoon of the last day of the conference and proceeded to decorate the hotel room. Ann's friends sneakily convinced Ann to take a side trip to another hotel room on the way to dinner. Ann's mother opened the door and a surprised Ann found Jason waiting in the center of the room where he <a name="recording">formally proposed</a>.</p>

							<p>Unlike Western traditions, the color white is <strong><em>avoided</em></strong> for Chinese weddings as that color is typically used at funerals. Instead red is the predominant color used in weddings as it represents good fortune and joy. The cover of the invite depicts a golden dragon and phoenix which is a symbol of harmonious balance in marriage between the husband (dragon) and the wife (phoenix).</p>

							<div class="inner-infostrip">Background</div>
							<p>We are extremely excited to share a traditional Chinese wedding banquet with you. Most of you probably think of Chinese food as wonton soup, lo mein, and shrimp fried rice. We will be eating authentic Chinese dishes and if you've never had <strong><em><u>real</u></em></strong> Chinese food, they you're in for a treat! A Chinese banquet typically includes at least 8 dishes. The dishes are served family style and a set of dishes may arrive in rapid fashion. It's important to pace yourself because many of the best dishes are later in the sequence. Several of the dishes have specific meaning associated with them. The menu has not yet been set as it depends on the number of guests attending - but you can look forward to at least a chicken dish, a duck dish, a lobster dish, and a noodle dish. Please let Jason or Ann know about any food restrictions  - we will do our best to accommodate you!</p>

							<p>Most wedding favors are somewhat frivolous trinkets that people order in bulk and seem very impersonal. Sure it may have the name of the bride and groom printed on it, but really - are you really going to hold onto that magnet or paperweight? We wanted something that was deeply personal and that you would enjoy. As wedding favors, we <strong><em><u>made</u></em></strong> you jam! We started by picking fruit together, cutting and processing it, combining all the raw ingredients, and canning it into 8 oz jars. We'll have five different flavors to choose from and there will be a set sampler jars at each table for you to try before you choose which flavor to take home with you. Of course there'll only be so many of each flavor at the table so you'll have to negotiate with your neighbors!</p>

							<p>Weddings are always extraordinarily busy for the bride and groom. Jason and Ann wanted to make sure they had the chance to socialize with friends and give guests a chance to get to know one another in a less formal setting. So they decided to host a board game party the night before the wedding! Fun board games will be on hand but feel free to bring your favorite game to play! Outside alcoholic beverages are not permitted but can be purchased from the hotel cafe just down the hall.</p>

Once you've parked, make your way to the 5th floor, follow signs to the hotel and walk across the short sky bridge. Upon entering the hotel, the hotel lobby is a few short steps in front of you. Facing the lobby desk, walk to the left until you reach the elevators. Facing the elevators, walk to the left down the hall and the Fenton Room is the first room on the right.</p>

Upon completion, there will be plenty of parking available at the Visitor Center and the Fragrance Garden is a short walk away. Guests at the Courtyard by Marriott can use the hotel shuttle to travel to Brookside Gardens. Note that there's only one shuttle and it  holds 8 people so please coordinate with fellow guests to ensure timely arrival!</p>

							<div class="inner-infostrip">Parking</div>
							<p>The restaurant does <strong><em><u>not</u></em></strong> have a parking lot. There is a small drop-off area available for guests requiring assistance. Street parking is available and there are multiple public parking lots nearby (see map). Parking is free after 6pm so you will need to feed the meter only enough to cover the time from your arrival to 6pm. The Wheaton Metro Station is also a short 5-7 minute walk from the restaurant. Hotel guests can <a class="outbound" onclick="trackOutboundLink(this.href); return false;" href="https://goo.gl/maps/t5S3WFJGBe32">ride the Red Line</a> metro 2 stops from nearby Silver Spring Station towards Glenmont.</p>
